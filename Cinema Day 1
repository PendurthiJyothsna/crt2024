There is a practice of showing a cinema in the auditorium of a college on a cinema day. A cinema day is a day where the sum of Day(D), Month(M), Year(Y)should be divisible by product of 3 and 4. On that particular day the total number of students in the hostel should be greater than 50 but less than 100. Write a program to find whether the given day is cinema day or not.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int d, m, y, s; 
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &d, &m, &y, &s); 
    int sum = d + m + y; 
    int product = 3 * 4; 
    if (sum % product == 0 && s > 50 && s < 100) 
    { 
        printf("Cinema Day\n"); 
    } 
    else 
    { 
        printf("Not a Cinema Day\n"); 
    }

    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */    
    return 0;
}
