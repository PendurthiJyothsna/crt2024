A supermarket maintains a pricing format for all its products. A value N is printed on each product. When the scanner reads the value N on the item, the product of all the digits in the value N is the price of the item. The task here is to design the software such that given the code of any item N the product (multiplication) of all the digits of value should be computed(price).
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int n, p = 1;
scanf("%d", &n);
while(n!= 0) {
    int d = n % 10;
    if(d!= 0) {
        p *= d;
    }
    n /= 10;
}
printf("%d\n", p);

    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */    
    return 0;
}
